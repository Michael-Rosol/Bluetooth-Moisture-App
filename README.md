# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Moisture Embedded Project

## Overview
This embedded systems project uses a I2C based capacitive sensor to monitor the hydration levels of a plant. Data from the sensor is then passed from the Nordic DK through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to an IOS app. The goal of the project was to successfully monitor the hydration levels of a houseplan throughout the day without being physically present around the plant. 

## Technologies Used
Nordic 5340 Development Kit
I2C capacitive sensor
Zephyr RTOS 
Swift/Xcode
